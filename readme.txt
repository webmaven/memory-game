Project Description:

Let's have some fun and implement a game called Memory Grid. 

The game starts by presenting a grid (N by M grid) with some elements highlighted to the end user.

After a brief while, the grid will be flipped over, with all the elements reset and no longer highlighted.

The user is asked to click the positions of the grids that were highlighted previously, within a set period of time. 

If the user gets it right, we will go to the next stage by presenting a more challenging game level by either increase the number of the highlighted grids (while fixing the grid size) or by increasing the grid size or both. Certainly the position of the highlighted grid elements should change. 

If the user does not guess correctly, we will reset the game with similar difficulty. 

We will play unit the user cannot proceed or can recall all blocks correctly and you've reached the end of the available options.  

This should be a dynamic, front-end only web app. You should try to use the best of javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and whatever javascript / CSS framework you would like. You should honor the "Honor Code" and do not copy if you find existing examples on the web. We're looking for how you architect, organize and execute this from a coding point of view.

Once complete, we'll probably want you to walk a few of us through your work and have a little Q&A about how you went about this.
